A journal on the dissection of a ZJTL Piano Toy Keyboard

This is a website made as part of an assignment for my ECE 4723 Embedded Systems class in the Spring of 2020.

# why?
Because it's for a grade lmao (It is a fun project, though :))

# how?
Bootstrap, and someone else's code. Specifically, Blackrock Digital LLC's scrolling-nav theme, found here:
