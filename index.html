          <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
          <p class="lead"> The ZJTL Piano Toy Keyboard is manufactured by Zhejiang Tianlong Optoelectronics Technology Co. Ltd., located 
            in the Zhejiang province of China. At the time of listing, it was sold as a direct-from-manufacturer product 
            on Amazon for the price of $9.99 USD. Interestingly, this price point was not recorded by price-tracking applications (see below).</p>

          <img src="img/price-history.png" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="A line graph depicting the price history of the keyboard.">

          This product was not found in the second-hand market, has no market history to speak of, and has no whitelabel, rebranded, or OEM versions.

          <h2>Dissection</h2>
          <p class="lead">For the dissection of the ZJTL Piano Toy Keyboard, I used the following tools:
            <ul>
              <li>Screwdriver</li>
              <li>Silicone project mat with screw trays</li>
              <li>work lamp</li>
              <li>My trusty Opinel No. 6 pocket knife</li>
              <li>Digital Kitchen Scale</li>
              <li>iPhone 6s</li>
            </ul>

          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            <img src="img/journal/001.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The keyboard, the included microphone, and the owner's manual">

            We begin the dissection by removing the nine screws in the back of the piano's body, as well as the screw 
            holding the battery compartment closed. I anticipate that the manufacturer has hidden a screw beneath it.
          </p>

          <h3>Front Matter</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            These screws seem particularly small, so I will be using a 000 Phillips Head bit.

            <img src="img/journal/002.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The back of the keyboard">
            <img src="img/journal/003.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The screw hiding in the battery compartment">

            My previous suspicion confirmed. This brings the screw count up to 10, or 11 if you include the battery compartment cover's.

            <img src="img/journal/004.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The back of the keyboard with all screws removed">

            Unscrewing these placed a concerning amount of mechanical strain on the body of the keyboard; All screws on 
            the edge of the body caused a considerable amount of bowing of the plastic, as well as some creaking sounds. 
            This may go without saying, but judging by the use of screws with pointed tips, I don't think the manufacturer 
            intended for this keyboard to be disassembled. Additionally, the screws themselves were extremely softâ€”I stripped one with minimal torque.
          </p>

          <h3>The Reveal</h3>
          <p class="lead">

            I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. I understood that this would likely be a very simple system, not this simple.

            <img src="img/journal/005.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The keyboard, opened">
            
            Immediately, I notice that one of the speakers. . . well. . . does not actually exist; one of the sets of holes made for sound to pass through was included only for aesthetic purposes.

            <img src="img/journal/006.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The close up of the PCB inside the keyboard">

            Additionally, it seems that all components are wired to this <it>one</it> board. I'm still wondering how this 
            thing manages to have <it>twenty-four</it> demo songs stored on it, not to mention (what I assume at this stage of my understanding of this product) all the wave-tables for each instrument.

            <img src="img/journal/007.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="The close up of the part number on the PCB">

            Two things strike me as important from this image.

            <ol>
              <li>What appears to be some sort of ID of the board design itself.</li>
              <li>The screenprinting on the IC</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            My camera phone is only capable of so much (and I have misplaced every free clip-on camera phone lens I have received from recruiters at job fairs), so you will have to trust me when I say that it reads:

            <p class="text-monospace">
              MPAK<br/>
              LM386<br/>
              M-1<br/>
            </p>

          </p>

          <h3>A Quick Aside: Investigation of Parts</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            The part number and date listed on the board itself interested me the most, so I plugged it into a search engine:

            <img src="img/journal/008.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Duck Duck Go finding no results for the PCB's Part number">

            The results were disappointing, but I chalked up this initial failure to DuckDuckGo's sometimes inferior indexing, and turned to Google. . .

            <img src="img/journal/009.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Google finding no results for the PCB's Part number">

            . . . which gave equally disappointing results. I decided to loosen up the search parameters by removing the 
            quotation marks, and was presented with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqphxjTINkw">this Youtube video</a> of a review of a children's synthesizer. 
            Neither the description nor the comments contained the string in question, but the relevance to the dissection was interesting.
          </p>
          <h4>Part 2: The LM386</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            This one was as easy to find as I had hoped. The LM386 is a Low Voltage Audio Power Amplifier manufactured by Texas Instruments.
            
            <img src="img/journal/010.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid" alt="Screenshot of the Texas Instruments Datasheet for the LM386">

            <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm386.pdf">datasheet</a><br/>

            I would fully expect this keyboard to contain an amplifier, seeing that it is an audio device, but the fact 
            that this chip isn't "the brains of this operation," so to speak, leaves me worried that the chip doing the 
            audio processing is hidden under a blob of black epoxy as is so annoyingly common with these devices.
